                        I am a new transfer student who started this semester and I plan on pursuing a Computer Science major. Something you should know about me is that I enjoy learning new things and adding them to my toolbelt. This Composition II class lets students get a bit creative with their writing and I want to make the most of that, as it can help connect the themes of writing with other subjects that interest me. Even though reading and writing isn't my forte, I see it as something to challenge myself and improve upon.
                        <br><br>If I had to describe my journey when it comes to learning and building skills that can be applied outside of a writing class, it involves a lot of self-discovery and learning experiences about subject matter as well as my own personal writing techniques. My journey was one based on discovery, about myself and the learning outcomes of this writing class. I plan to illustrate this theme of discovery by illustrating an experience similar to my own and showing my discoveries in a way that is reflective of my own experience and growth as a writer.

                        The reading responses we have done in this course helped me to understand subjects talked about in class as well as prepare me for future assignments that require background knowledge. They were formatted in a way where we would read selected passages on the topic at hand, and then reflect on the reading according to the questions that were asked of me. All in all, these were a great way at preparing me for the content covered in this course that felt like a good stepping stone for preparing me for the course content. The readings themselves provided me with [1] General Inquiry since they served to deepen our knowledge on relatively new topics and based on how little we knew beforehand, the readings served to spark curiosity.

                        This assignment helped to really me to understand what Critical Conversations were at a time when I was still unsure on what a Critical Conversation really meant. Through this reading, I discovered a new topic which would serve to be critical in our final research paper that this class eventually concludes with.

                        This assignment served a role in helped me understand genres better before we were tasked with deciding what genre we wanted to look into for our final research paper. As one would expect, this assignment prepared me for a future assignment that would prove to be a bit tricky for the class overall. Discovering the definition of a genre in the writing sense and being able to leverage this new key concept proved to be helpful in the preparation phase for our final research paper.

                        Just like the activities prior that helped me to prepare for bigger assignments, these two assignments played a big role in laying down the foundation and doing some preemptive work that would make the next corresponding assignment more manageable. What I discovered about myself as a result of these kind of assignments is how much I succumb to assignments that appear daunting. I realize now how effective splitting up work can be for my productivity and mentality, but trying to split a big assignment up on my own usually backfires since you almost have to hardwire your brain into thinking it's not one big assignment with a set deadline, but rather 2 smaller assignments with deadlines that you decided on. Because of this inability to mentally split up work, I am unable to take advantage of this workflow. After reflecting upon the reason why I am unable to split up my work, I believe it falls upon my procrastination and perfectionist tendencies which have me submitting assignments very close to their appointed deadlines and if I try to establish my own deadlines, I end up going past those deadlines because "make believe" deadlines don't hold as much weight in my conscious and it becomes too easy to brush off deadlines if they don't have much weight behind them.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        To summarize, creating a foundational assignment which can then be built upon by a proceeding assignment is an effective way of splitting up a large assignment into more manageable pieces. With my tendencies, I struggle to split up assignments on my own, so I appreciate when teachers design the course to help us in that way.

                    <p>
                        The Synthesis Chart was an assignment that tested my ability to find and evaluate scholarly sources that were credible and relevant to my research paper, which falls in line with the course outcome of [3] Information Literacy. This assignment and the one that follows it, Literature Review & Annotated Bibliography (Feedback draft), were the most challenging for me likely because of the fact that it involved finding scholarly articles that were relevant to my area of interest was not easy in the slightest. The main issues that arose were that not many articles have been published on my area of interest and the sources that I did end up finding could be considered a stretch since they didn't directly correlate with my subject area but they were similar enough to the subject matter. I discovered from this assignment that not everything is going to go your way and that sometimes you need to get creative and do what makes you uncomfortable in order to push through undecisive moments.

                        This assignment helped ease me into the researching phase of the final research paper, where I ended up practicing [2] Multiple Ways of Writing in order to evaluate and categorize similarities present across the data I collected for my research paper. I found it helpful as a foundational assignment because it laid down a good foundation to get me familiar with the data collection process as well as evaluating trends as I go through the data. This discovery of categorically boxing data and evaluating data while in the process of collecting data opened my eyes to the methods of multitasking and being more efficent with the way I do my assignments.

                        One of the things that became apparent during this process of learning and discovery was how everything was new and intimidating. When faced with these feelings, it was crucial to have references not only to figure out what the Dos and Don'ts are, but also to see how other people approach the topics we covered in class and learn from those who have done an exemplary job. Being able to examine stand-out works, pick them apart, and see not only how but why they do things has helped me to become a better writer simply by following in other people's footsteps. It is the sort of discovery that is the most impactful because it comes purely from your own curiosity and intrigue, stemming from [1] Genuine Inquiry.

                        While I was constantly discovering new writing ideas and topics in class, the textbook Easy Writer allowed me to answer any lingering questions I had for any topic, acting as a sort of guide for those who are lost. It wasn't that easy to navigate at first from my experience, but it is something you can become acquainted with. It comes in handy when you are looking for something specific. I found myself searching up the organization and format of genres as well as examples of genre writings in academic disciplines, to better understand [4] Research Genre Production which are found in sections 10b and 10e respectively.

                        Whenever dealing with new challenges, you are bound to run into roadblocks. That is exactly what happened to me when it came to finding the right scholarly sources and making sure they fit with our understanding of [3] Information Literacy. I started discovering more about the way I work and my tendencies to read slow, write slow and to overall be needlessly critical when it came to evaluating things. When it comes to dealing with these roadblocks, I've found that it is best to reflect on why you are experiencing them and fixing the source of your problem. In my case, it was an issue of being too critical, and not feeling enough urgency which resulted in my work flow being rather slow and my priorities were set on doing a good job by my standards rather than meeting a deadline.

                    <p>
                        This assignment was one of the most crucial ones in my opinion because it set me up for the final research paper and it broke off a substantial piece of work that would have stunted my progress if it had not been its own assignment. Additionally, it helped me understand a realistic time span that the final research paper would take me which had proved to be a worthwhile discovery. I am equal parts proud and disappointed with my efforts, because I feel that I did an excellent job on this assignment based on how much [6] Revision went into it but at the same time I spent way too long on an assignment and I turned it in late, causing me to recieve a poor grade for the amount of effort I put in. It hurts to look back on this assignment, but I hope that it can be a learning experience for me on my path towards improving myself.

                        Although I felt good about some parts of this paper and the effort I put in, other parts felt rushed and imperfect. There isn't much I can do about it now, but accept what I have and keep trudging forward. In a way, it is similar to any new thing you try. First you will struggle and you may not be happy with the results, but you can only get better with practice so you must keep going with your future self in mind.

                    <p>
                        This paper served to meet quite a lot of the learning outcomes such as [1] Generating Inquiry with how we are expected to choose a genre which intrigues us, [2] Multiple Ways of Writing with how we choose to examine topics that involve multimodality as well as incorporating visuals into our papers, [3] Information Literacy with how we attained our data and our scholarly sources in a way that includes variety but also how the evidence is effective and meaningful towards our paper, [4] Research Genre Production and how we go about analyzing the genre in respect to the audience, its purpose, the key features, and tying it back to the rhetoric of the genre, [5] Contributing Knowledge with how I am establishing a niche and bringing new information to the conversation and [6] Revision with the way I have polished parts of the paper to make it meet my standards.

                        With all the learning outcomes, I discovered a lot of the facets of writing and the connections it has with rhetoric and composition. It without a doubt had its ups and downs, and I find that I need to not take things to heart when it comes to the effort I put in and the outcomes that follow. Contrary to what the saying goes, for me it is the destination that matters and not the journey. You can't get where you want to be if you are always criticizing yourself since that will weight heavy on your mind and become a source of demotivation. I think there are takeaways from this class that aren't purely writing based that I will be able to make use of effectively, such as composition, reflection, and time management. I am ready to move on towards better things, but the writing practice this class gave me will serve to help me in future writing classes, since writing is one of my weaker subjects. I just need to keep moving forward.
